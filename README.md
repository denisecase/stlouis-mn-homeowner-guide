## Essential References by Topic

### Permits, Zoning & Land Use
- Planning & Zoning Department (includes zoning ordinance & permit info): <https://www.stlouiscountymn.gov/departments-a-z/planning-zoning>
- Impervious surfaces (e.g. rooftops, decks, sidewalks, patios, swimming pools, driveways) must be less than 25% of the lot.
- Max building height is 25 ft.
- The shoreland rules refer to bluffs as any slope draining towards a water body, where the grade between the toe of the bluff and a point at least 25 feet above the OHWL averages at least 30 percent, except for an area with an average slope of less than 18 percent over a distance of at least 50 feet.
- The use of stairways, lifts and landings is preferred when planning for access up and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must be no wider than four feet on residential lots and placed in the most visually inconspicuous portions of the lot. Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots should not exceed 32 square feet. Canopies or roofs are not allowed on these structures.

- DNR Buffer Law and Resources: <https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/buffers/index.html>
- DNR North St. Louis County: <https://www.nslswcd.org/>
- These setbacks apply to dwellings and most structures.
- The setback is measured horizontally from the Ordinary High Water Level (OHWL) inland to the nearest point of a structure or building.
- DNR Basin Shoreland Classifications: <https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/waters/watermgmt_section/shoreland/basins_shoreland_classifications.pdf>
  - General Development Lakes: 75 feet from OHWL  
  - Recreational Development Lakes: 100 feet from OHWL  
  - Natural Environment Lakes: 150 feet from OHWL
- Shore Impact Zone (SIZ) is the first half of the structure setback distance from the OHWL.
- Selective removal of dead or hazardous vegetation (e.g., for fire safety) is allowed.
- General mowing, grading, or vegetation clearing is not permitted without review.
- Maintaining natural vegetation along the shoreline helps stabilize soil, filter runoff, and preserves the natural appearance of the shore.
- Erosion-resistant native groundcovers may be planted if **no fertilizers or herbicides** are used.

### Shoreland Access and Structures

- **Shoreline Access Path:**
  - A single 4-foot-wide path is allowed through the Shore Impact Zone (SIZ) to provide reasonable access to the water (e.g., dock, launch).
  - Path must minimize erosion and vegetation removal, and should meander to avoid channeling runoff directly into the lake.
  - No permit is required for a natural path if it meets these guidelines.
    
- **Water-Oriented Accessory Structures (WOAS):**  
  - May be permitted near the shoreline (e.g., fish house, boathouse, sauna, or small storage shed).  
  - Limited to 250 square feet maximum and one structure per lot.
  - Must be setback at least 10 feet from the OHWL (Ordinary High Water Level).  
  - Cannot be used as a dwelling or contain plumbing.
  - May require a land use permit depending on design and placement.

- **Docks & Boat Lifts:**  
  - No permit required for seasonal docks or lifts if:  
    - They are no wider than 8 feet  
    - Do not obstruct navigation  
    - Are not permanently affixed (i.e., removed seasonally)  
  - Additional requirements may apply for platforms, canopy frames, or pilings
